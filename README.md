# SQL Employee | Data Modeling | Data Engineering | Data Analysis

In this pproject, I will design the tables to hold data in the CSVs, import the CSVs into a SQL database, and answer questions about the data.

Data Modeling

From inspecting the CSVs, here is my ERD:

Data Engineering

Use the provided information to create a table schema for each of the six CSV files. Remember to specify data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints.

Import each CSV file into the corresponding SQL table.

Data Analysis

Once you have a complete database, perform these steps:

List the following details of each employee: employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary.

List first name, last name, and hire date for employees who were hired in 1986.

List the manager of each department with the following information: department number, department name, the manager's employee number, last name, first name.

List the department of each employee with the following information: employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

List first name, last name, and sex for employees whose first name is "Hercules" and last names begin with "B."

List all employees in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

List all employees in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

List the frequency count of employee last names (i.e., how many employees share each last name) in descending order.
